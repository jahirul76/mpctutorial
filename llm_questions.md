Great! I found the link. Let me fetch the bin collection information from Harrow Council:

Unfortunately, I can't access the interactive postcode lookup tool directly through the web fetch, as it requires JavaScript to search for your specific bin collection day. However, you can easily find this information by:

Going to Harrow Council's bin collection checker: Visit https://www.harrow.gov.uk/bins-waste-recycling and enter your postcode HA9 7ns in the address search box
Check the 2026 bin day calendar: Harrow also provides a downloadable 2026 calendar that shows all bin collection dates
The site will show you:

Your collection day this week
Which bins are collected (general waste, recycling, garden waste)
Your full collection schedule
Alternatively, you can sign up for bin day notifications at the same Harrow Council page to get reminders sent to you automatically.
